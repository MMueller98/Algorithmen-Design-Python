# Algorithmen-Design-Python
This is my repository, which I built up during the module "Algorithmic Design" at Trier University of Applied Sciences. The repositorycontains the analysis of several algorithm mines according to the pattern: problem description, modeling, algorithmic design, analysis (running time, correctness), implementation and testing.

Python was used as the programming language. The main topics of the course were graph theory, Greedy design patterns, divide and conquer, recursion equations, principles of dynamic programming.
